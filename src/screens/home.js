        If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. In
        this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be
        tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games — but give it
        a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to
        building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper
        understanding. Step-by-Step Guide If you prefer to learn concepts step
        by step, our guide to main concepts is the best place to start. Every
        next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous
        chapters so you won’t miss anything as you go along. Thinking in React
        Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React
        finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough
        but it’s still just as relevant. Recommended Courses Sometimes people
        find third-party books and video courses more helpful than the official
        documentation. We maintain a list of commonly recommended resources,
        some of which are free. Advanced Concepts Once you’re comfortable with
        the main concepts and played with React a little bit, you might be
        interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to
        the powerful, but less commonly used React features like context and
        refs.
